# store-of-words

My local word manager for language learning.

## Description
My motivation to create this app started when i start learning English. 
I started using one method for remembering words in context and it was as follows : 
	1. Take a sentence , repeat the sentence twice a day for a week(read out loud)
	2. Then a week break, and then one more time 2 times a day but only one day
	3. Repeat point 2 again.
I used Evernote and when the system grew, it was extremely inconvenient for management.

I decided to solve this problem by creating this application where with the help of one button I can manage everything and not waste my time and all I have to do is repeat.
